## Hydroloan, a loan provider, has noticed that several of their customers are failing to repay their loans. As a solution, Hydroloan intends to construct a machine learning (ML) model capable of precisely forecasting which customers are prone to default on their loans. This approach would permit Hydroloan to identify potentially high-risk customers beforehand and take proactive measures to decrease their default rate. The objective is to create an ML model that can effectively anticipate which customers are likely to default on their loans, allowing Hydroloan to proactively decrease their default rate.

# PROJECT STEPS:
* Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.
* Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify patterns or trends.
* Feature engineering to select the most relevant features that impact loan default rates.
* Model selection and testing using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and decision trees.
* Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the effectiveness of the model.



## It can be concluded that logistic regression is a superior model for predicting loan default compared to the decision tree. This is because logistic regression achieved higher accuracy, precision, and F1 score. These results suggest that the logistic regression model is better at correctly identifying loan defaults, which can lead to more effective risk management for the lending institution.
